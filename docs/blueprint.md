- User Header: Implement a header that displays the logged-in user's name (mocked with 'Usu√°rio Teste') and a placeholder logout button.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Matte black (#0D0D0D) to provide a dark and premium feel.
- Primary color: Purple (#8B5CF6) for a modern and stylish look.
- Secondary color: Gold (#FACC15) as an accent color to highlight important elements.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, premium, and readable UI.
- Use Tailwind CSS to create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes, with a fixed sidebar on desktop and a collapsible sidebar on mobile.  Cards should have rounded corners (2xl) and a subtle glassmorphic effect.
- Apply subtle fade-in animations to the main content area for a smooth user experience.
